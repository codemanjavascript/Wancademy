General Information and Todo List 
----------------------------------- 

Github: https://github.com/codemanjavascript/Wancademy 
Username: codemanjavascript 
Password (see document): https://rb.gy/oid0pp 

Instructions to Get Workspace: 
Go on github and download the files and upload them to visual studio code, or get the USB with the files in it and load it into visual studio code. After, you need to install mongod, and to do that, make a new terminal on the bottom, then use the correct instructions to start it (check c9 or search google "c9 mongoDB set up"). With VSC, you need to start it by tying "mongod" in terminal 2. After, in terminal 1, write "node app.js", which will take then make localhost:3000 work. Just type that in the web address, then it should be working!

1) Go to : https://github.com/codemanjavascript/wancademy and download the master file. Download Node.js, Visual studio code. 
 
2) Upload the new folder by dragging and dropping on to the empty vsc layout. Having that you have your packages now.
 
3) Go to main terminal on the laptop and type: xcode-select --install ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)" enter password for computer brew install mongodb-community 
  
4) To Start Database: brew services start mongodb-community 
  
5) To Stop Database: brew services stop mongodb-community
  
6) Then, make a terminal in vsc by going to terminal tab, new, and type in all the npm packages. To do this, go to npm.com (or whatever the site is), go to the package.json file, and download and type everything in.
   
7) Then to start the program, make another terminal, and type node app.js. You can also add nodemon, a npm that allows for a shortcut to start the server 

8) To connect to the github to get live updating as shown above: 
    command shift p 
    type git clone 
    paste https://github.com/codemanjavascript/wancademy and then there should be a refresh icon in the blue stuff at the very bottom. 
    
    make some changes, click on the git tab, and test it out. 
    If this doesn't work and shows “git clone not found” 
        in VSC, xcode-select --install 
        Check if Git is installed: Git --version
        If not, choose another workspace and do it there.
